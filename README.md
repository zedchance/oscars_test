# oscars_test

This is a test repo, the files under `src` are just an example of formatted and documented code, they don't have
anything to do with our project.

This demonstrates an easy way we can get some of the extra points for the project.
For example:

- Adopt a coding standard and follow it
    - IntelliJ makes it easy to enforce a code standard, we can debate that standard.
    - The file `.idea/codeStyles/Project.xml` and `.idea/codeStyles/codeStyleConfig.xml` ensure that the entire project
    follows the coding standard
- Well-designed HTML page documenting API endpoints and example inputs/outputs
    - JavaDoc makes generating documentation easy, check out the comments in the file `src/MaxPQ.java`, comments like
    that turn into the page [here](https://zedchance.github.io/oscars_test).
- Incorporate test-driven development practice for one Sprint
    - JUnit can be used for unit tests, check out the file `src/MaxPQTest.java`
- Explain and document obstacles encountered during the project and how those obstacles were handled
    - I was thinking for this we could use the GitHub issues system
